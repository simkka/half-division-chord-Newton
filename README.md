<h1>Programming project - C++ - numerical methods</h1>
<h2>Half-division method, the chord method, and the Newton method</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this lab, I worked with nonlinear equations and methods for solving them. Using the C++ language, I programmed the half-division method, the chord method, and the Newton method. Based on the results of the programs, you can see that each method works quite accurately, but the half-division method requires much more iterations than the chord method or the Newton method.
